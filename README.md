## Utilize the Challenge
This challenge used many node packages, mySQL2, sequelize, handlebars, and express-session.  I also utilized an dotenv package to store environmental variables and a bycryptjs package to secure the passwords stored.  The challenge navigates through a series of folder structures to compartmentalize and organize the viewer with the views folder and javascript folders to the controller folder with the routes then on to the model folder create the databases.  All of this ties together for the Model-View Controller pattern.

## Run the Program
Open up the Integrated Terminal at the server.js within the file.  Type npm start or node server.js.  It will ask for you to go to a local host url in which you can input your username and password, enter in your web blogs and they will be saved in the database for you to view or edit later.  This development will be uploaded to Heroku for easier usability.
